/*
Pseudo Code:
8 team football 1 round elimination bracket

functions:
ReadFile - read the input file and extract the information
	remember to check to see if format is correct, otherwise terminate program and tell user that file is not formatted correctly

TeamAssignments - randomly assign teams to play

PrintBracket - display the current bracket

Touchdown - touchdown probability using random number between 0 and 1
	if number is less than probability, team scores
	if number is greater, team doesn't score

Fieldgoal - fieldgoal probability using random number between 0 and 1

PlaybyPlay - if user wants to watch, generate the play by play
	otherwise, just display who wins with the score and the game number

TouchdownTable - touchdown statistics for each team at the end of the conference

FieldgoalTable - fieldgoal statistics for each team at the end of the conference
