Sorry but I ran out of time and my game doesn't work all too well. You need a 1920x1080 display to see the whole game window. When players get low on funds and cannot pay someone, nothing happens and the game continues, thus the game can go on forever. When a player has to draw cards from the decks, implementing the actions caused a seg fault and I didn't have enough time to debug it (so no functionality is there.) When a player resigns, a message pops up and ends the game, but the window itself doesn't close. Other than that, the game runs much like a normal game of monopoly.
