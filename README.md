# USC CSCI 103 - Intro to C++

This is a repository containing all of my C++ work.
All of this work was made before I knew how to use git so many of the monopoly folders are just older/buggier versions of the final product.

RealMonopoly contains my final project designed to run in the console.
Within the folder is an executable file named monopoly. (./monopoly while in the folder should start the program)

monopolyqt contains my final project of monopoly designed to run with a GUI.
Some of the functionality was lost in the conversion.
Players can still roll the die, physically move and purchase property (cars.)
However, landing on an opposing player's car will force you to pay the player which happens instantly, making it difficult to witness the interaction.
Furthermore, the community chest and chance cards do not work as I had planned on making pop ups of every description and had run out of time.

Both final versions of monopoly do not have mortgaging property implemented because I could not quite work out the logic of that function.
Full descriptions of each project are stored as design.txt's in the corresponding folders.

A resolution of at least 1600x900 is needed to display the game board in its entirety.
All work was done in Ubuntu.
